    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li>
      <li>
        1 ounce soft French cheese, such as Boursin cheese (any flavor),
        crumbled
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until yolks and
        whites are completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs
        into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just
        starting to set. Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook until
        just slightly underdone and shiny. If necessary, move extra raw egg
        around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to prevent
        browning, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2 teaspoons
        chives. Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the
        other side, so the omelet is folded in thirds. Remove to a plate and
        sprinkle with remaining chives.
      </li>
    </ol>

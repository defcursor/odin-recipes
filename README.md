# Odin Recipes Project

This is a basic recipe website project built using HTML, where users can find links to different recipes. The project aims to demonstrate the following skills:

- Creating a basic HTML structure for a website
- Setting up a GitHub repository and cloning it to a local machine
- Organizing files and folders in a Git repository
- Writing meaningful commit messages and using Git version control
- Building a simple recipe page with content and navigation links

This project is a starting point for further development, where we will revisit it in the future to add CSS styling and enhance the user experience.
